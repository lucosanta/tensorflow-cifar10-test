# CIFAR-10 Tensorflow Test
A test to improve my abilities on Tensorflow

## Actions
In this algorithm I had to:
  * Import CIFAR-10
  * Convert dataset to TfRecord
  * Read TFRecord file
  * Create batch
  * Create a model with 3 Conv Layer and 2 Fully Connected Layers
  * Optimizer is Adam with parametric Learning Rate with a decay 
  * Training for 1000 epochs
  * Results are written for Tensorboard analysis
